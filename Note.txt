----------------------------------------------------------------

The key is:
- Tab and shift Tab to go forward and backwards to the next accordion
- Space or Enter to open | close the accordion

with role='region' in the accordion-content, in window,
once you tabs and open with keyboard, and in narrator, type 'd', it will go to the next region area.
without it, there is not easy way to jump to that area.
so it's important to have aria-labelledby + role
